# Fast Writer Adaptation

This code is part of the implementation of the handwritten text recognition experiments in the paper [Fast writer adaptation with style extractor network for handwritten text recognition](https://sciencedirect.53yu.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608021004755). The code is developed based on the Pytorch framework.

For the HETR task:

IF you only need the backbone recognition network in Fig.4, just run the train_CTC_HAM_Vis_Contex.py;

Train the writer style extractor network in Fig.5, run the train_WID.py;
